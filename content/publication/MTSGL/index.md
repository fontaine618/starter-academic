abstract: "We propose an alternating direction of multipliers method (ADMM) based on the
consensus scheme for solving regularized multi-task problems where the loss function is separable
across tasks. We discuss the convergence of the algorithm and survey its statistical properties
in the sparse group Lasso case. Through numerical experiments, we find that our proposed
method can be particularly efficient in the number of proximal evaluations required to achieve
convergence when compared to a more general method such as FISTA."
