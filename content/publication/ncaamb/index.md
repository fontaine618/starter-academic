abstract: "We propose a latent variable model for paired
comparisons in the context of Basketball scores. Based on the
model proposed by [1], our model assumes multi-dimensional
latent skills decomposed into offensive and defensive components
as well as team- and conference-specific skills interacting with
each other through an inner product model. We propose two
inference approaches: maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
and mean-field variational inference (VI). Applied to the 2004-
2017 NCAA Men’s Basketball season’s, the MLE approach
yields adequate and interpretable results, but the VI approach
was not as successful. Based on the MLE inference, we study
the relationship between teams and conferences, we investigate
league-wide trends over time and we produce rankings of teams
and conferences."
