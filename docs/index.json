With this project, we will assess the ability of umpires to make ball and strike calls that match the rulebook and that are consistent across different game situations. Using nonlinear classification methods such as kernel linear regression and support vector machines we can learn a strike zone for each umpire based on pitch location as well as game circumstances. After learning strike zone classifiers for each game situation and umpire combination, we use kernel PCA to create a low dimensional encoding of the strike zones that can be used for inference. We perform multiple analysis of variance and mixed effects multivariate regression on the principal components to determine which factors have a statistically significant effect on an umpire’s strike zone. Finally we compute a ranking of each umpire and compare our top umpires with those featured on other lists.","tags":null,"title":"Caught Looking: Analyzing Variation in Umpire Strike Zones","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon Fontaine","Trong Dat Do"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585790187,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585790187,"objectID":"29573574d35ce04d025445e52642be51","permalink":"https://www.fontaine618.github.io/publication/movielens/","publishdate":"2020-04-01T20:16:27-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/movielens/","section":"publication","summary":"The MovieLens datasets contain user ratings of movies as well as movie and user information.

Despite the wide use and simple nature of single-target approaches, modeling these types of data may benefit from a simultaneous approach. We propose a unified algorithm to perform sparse learning of such fused insurance data under the Tweedie (compound Poisson) model. By integrating ideas from multi-task sparse learning and sparse Tweedie modeling, our algorithm produces flexible regularization that balances predictor sparsity and between-sources sparsity. When applied to simulated and real data, our approach clearly outperforms single-target modeling in both prediction and selection accuracy, notably when the sources do not have exactly the same set of predictors.

The MCMC methods, along with their adaptive and multiple-try extensions, are thoroughly explored (both in their possible variations and in their theoretical properties) in order to firmly anchor  the study of the proposed adaptive Multiple-Try Metropolis (aMTM) algorithm. Moreover, some existing results on the properties of MTM algorithms are generalized to enable more general results about the aMTM algorithm. The ergodicity of the algorithm is then established using well known results of Roberts and Rosenthal (2007), Andrieu and Moulines (2006) and Craiu et al. (2015) and its empirical performance is studied through a series of simulation experiments. The aMTM algorithm achieves notably better performance than simpler samplers (non-adaptive or single-try) when applied to distributions that are multimodal or that exhibit complex geometry. Finally, many variations of the algorithm are proposed and compared to find combinations that are particularly more efficient. An implementation of the algorithm is provided in a **R** package called **aMTM** available at https://github.com/fontaine618/aMTM.

Solidly anchored in online approximate Bayesian inference, these modern algorithms only require a prior rating for each match participant and the outcome of the match to infer posterior ratings for each player. Efforts have been made in the last decade to incorporate auxiliary information in rating computations (such as players' score in a match or their proficiency in different game modes) in order to get more accurate rating updates as well as generally faster convergence to the true underlying skills. However, as ratings also influence the matchmaking and therefore the new ratings, their distribution over all players is a highly dynamic system, where the interdependence of ratings and matchmaking impedes our ability to fully understand the impacts of potential improvements on live applications. We shall survey existing rating systems and explore the assessment challenges involved in enhancing and extending these algorithms.","tags":null,"title":"Online Skill Rating Algorithm","type":"talk"}]
